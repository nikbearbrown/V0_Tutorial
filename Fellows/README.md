# Humanitarians AI Fellows Program

## Welcome to the Humanitarians AI Fellows Program!

This document outlines the requirements and expectations for all volunteers participating in Humanitarians AI projects. Following these guidelines is mandatory for receiving recommendation letters and acknowledgment of your contributions.

## Questions or Support

If you have any questions about these requirements or need assistance with GitHub, please contact us at: **hr.aihumanitarians@gmail.com**

## Getting Started

1. **Project Selection**: 
   - Review available projects at [Humanitarians AI GitHub](https://github.com/nikbearbrown/Humanitarians_AI)
   - Select a project that matches your interests and skills
   - Reach out to the project lead to express interest

2. **GitHub Setup (REQUIRED)**:
   - Each volunteer MUST add themselves as a collaborator on their chosen project's GitHub repository
   - You must use your personal GitHub account that clearly identifies you
   - If you're new to GitHub, please familiarize yourself with basic Git operations (commit, push, pull, etc.)

3. **Fellows Directory Setup**:
   - After being added as a collaborator, create your personal folder within the "Fellows" directory
   - Name the folder using the format: `Firstname_Lastname`
   - Create a profile README.md in your folder with:
     - Your name and contact information
     - Professional background/skills
     - Project role/interests
     - Start date with Humanitarians AI
     - Expected end date or duration of commitment

## Documentation Requirements

### Bi-Weekly Updates (MANDATORY)

All fellows MUST provide updates at minimum every two weeks. This is non-negotiable and essential for maintaining active status in the program.

Your bi-weekly updates should:

1. Be committed directly to your personal folder in the Fellows directory
2. Use the following naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD_update.md`
3. Include:
   - Summary of work completed in the past two weeks
   - Challenges encountered and how they were addressed
   - Goals for the next two weeks
   - Any resources or assistance needed
   - Hours contributed during this period

### Project Documentation

Beyond your personal updates, you should contribute to the project's main documentation as appropriate:

- Code comments
- Function/module documentation
- User guides
- Technical specifications
- Research findings

## Tracking and Evaluation

The GitHub-based tracking system provides an objective basis for evaluating your contributions. The following metrics will be considered when assessing your work:

- Frequency and quality of commits
- Consistency of bi-weekly updates
- Contributions to project milestones
- Collaboration with other team members
- Quality and impact of work produced

## Recommendation Letters and Verifications

### Recommendation Letters
Recommendation letters will only be issued to fellows who:
1. Have been active contributors for a minimum duration (typically 2-3 months)
2. Have maintained regular bi-weekly updates throughout their involvement
3. Have made substantial, verifiable contributions to their project
4. Have properly documented their work following the guidelines above

### Visa and Employment Verification

**IMPORTANT:** The same documentation requirements apply to any visa or employment verification requests:

- Active participation must be continuously documented through GitHub
- If you stop making bi-weekly updates, we will assume you left the program on the date of your last update
- Even if you continue working but fail to document it, we cannot verify participation beyond your last documented update
- Employment and visa verification letters will only reflect the dates and contributions that are properly documented in GitHub
- It is your responsibility to maintain an accurate record of your involvement through regular commits and updates

This policy exists to ensure integrity and accuracy in our official verifications. Humanitarians AI can only verify what is objectively documented in our systems.

## Entrepreneurship Program

### Requirements for Commercial Use of Project Work

If you plan to use code or other intellectual property developed during your volunteer work with Humanitarians AI for commercial purposes or to start a business, you **MUST**:

1. Apply to be part of the official Humanitarians AI Entrepreneurship Program
2. Acknowledge that Humanitarians AI will receive a 5% ownership stake in any resulting venture
3. Formalize this relationship through proper legal agreements

This requirement reflects the extensive support, mentorship, resources, and infrastructure that Humanitarians AI provides to its volunteers and projects. The organization actively encourages entrepreneurial initiatives while ensuring fair recognition of its contributions to your success.

### Intellectual Property Reminder

  **Please Star the Github repo that your project is in**

### Engagement Expectations

When evaluating extension requests and overall commitment to the program, we consider:

1. **Regular Engagement**: Following our social channels and engaging with posts
2. **Content Sharing**: Resharing Humanitarians AI content with your professional network
3. **Thoughtful Interaction**: Commenting on and supporting other fellows' achievements
4. **Community Ambassadorship**: Representing our mission in your professional communications

### Why Community Engagement Matters

Your engagement with our content and community demonstrates:
- Commitment to our shared mission beyond individual project work
- Support for the broader Humanitarians AI ecosystem
- Willingness to help expand our impact and reach
- Investment in the community's collective success

**Important Note**: While social media engagement is considered as a positive factor when evaluating extension requests and overall commitment, it complements but does not replace the mandatory GitHub documentation requirements outlined in this document. Proper documentation of your work remains the primary requirement for program participation and verification.

By following these guidelines, you'll not only create a valuable record of your contributions but also develop professional skills in documentation, collaboration, and project management that will benefit your future career.
